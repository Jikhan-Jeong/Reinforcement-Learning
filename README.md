# Reinforcement-Learning

This is for designing 

(1) Automate Smart Stock Trading
 - 1. building a better prediction for the stock price movement
 - 2. Automate with discrete state (sell/buy) and continous state by approximating (price)
 
(2) Automate Smart Thermostat
 - 1. control state (discrete)
 - 2. temperature state (continuous)

Therefore, I need to learn deeper
